# Hackclub Blueprint Doorbell

The main idea was not having to spend that much money on a brand Doorbell and get my first real experience in creating a PCB that runs completly local! Ofcourse the quality won't be the same as for example a reolink or ring doorbell but that's not the point of this project.
