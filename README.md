# Hackclub Blueprint Doorbell

The main idea was not having to spend that much money on a brand Doorbell and get my first real experience in creating a PCB that runs completly local! Ofcourse the quality won't be the same as for example a reolink or ring doorbell but that's not the point of this project.

## Fully assembled (note that the relaisboard isn't how it will look in the end. I couldn't find the exact model as a 3d model.)
